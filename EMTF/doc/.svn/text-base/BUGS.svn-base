April 16 2008: FC file headers do not contain set overlaps; they do
contain window lengths and sampling rates for each
decimation level.  To convert sample (record) numbers to set numbers
it is necessary to know sample rate, sample number for set number
one, and distance between sets (i.e., window length-overlap).
This computation has to be done in tranmt to map bad segments
(which can be marked in TSplot, and are recorded as sample
number relative to the "clock zero") to set numbers to be omitted.
At present tranmt ASSUMES that the overlap is .25 of the window
length ... this is hard-coded.  In all uses I have made of EMTF
overlaps have been .25, but in principal this could be set differently
in the decset file, and then tranmt would calculate set numbers
containing bad data segments incorrectly.  FIX: don't deviate
from the .25 overlap factor if you want to use the interactive software!

Long term, FC files should be changed to something like netCDF and
more complete and less obtuse header information should be provided.
