Filter calibrations are handled through the following routines:

1) getsp reads the sp file, including an array of filter type
    indices (iftype(:,:) and character strings afparam(:,:) (now of
    length 256 for each filter) that contain filter parameters
    required to complete filter specification for each type

2) fcorsu concatenates all filter responses + any other corrections
    needed to get Fourier coefficients into physical units of nT/sqt(hz)
    or mV/km/sqrt(hz).  If first difference prewhitening is used,
    this is included in the correction tables produced by this routine;
    If adaptive prewhitening is used this is not included, since the
    digital pre-whitening filter changes for each time segment.
    Correction for low pass digital filter applied before decimation is
    included.
    Filter responses can be specified in this routine, or in separate
    subroutines called by fcorsu.  At present there are two additional

3) afcor provides a place to speficy filter responses (those that are
     not a line or so, which might be specified in fcorsu).  Presently
     contains three routines, called by fcorsu: 
     afcor : a bunch of analogue filters, of specific types parameterized 
           by one or two numbers, e.g., a cut-off period.
     pz_rsp :  a general pole-zero response
     rsptbl : interpolate a system response look up table
     The last two were moved to this file in August 2006
