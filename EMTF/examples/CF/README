This directory contains "configuration" (*.cfg) files
used by EMTF processing programs.  In typical usage the contents
of this directory are copied to <survey>/CF and then
edited as necessary to adjust processing options for
a particular survey (accounting for gross differences
in sampling rates, period ranges, time series lengths, etc.)

The default *.cfg files are set up for typical long
period MT installations using NIMS systems: sampling
rates of 1 s, occupation times of 1-3 weeks.  

Following are the important files, and uses; see EMTF
documentation for more details.

--> paths.cfg 
This file is used by dnff to define *relative* paths for input
and output files.  E.g.,

data 			! data file directory (input)
SP			! system parameter file (*.sp) directory (input)
data/BR			! bad record file (*.bad) directory (input)
CF/decset.cfg       	! decset configuration file NAME (input)
CF/pwset.cfg		! pwset configuration file NAME (input)
FC			! directory for Fourier coefficient files (outputs)
CF/options_SS.cfg       !  
CF/options_RR.cfg       ! The final 3 lines give file names that are
CF/bsNIMS.cfg           !  not read by dnff ... these are not required.

The final 3 lines are read by the ArrayManager matlab program to define
relative path names for default *.cfg files used for running transfer
function programs: lines 1-3 are for single site, remote reference, and
(the band setup file for) multi-station processing.  If not present,
hard-coded default names are used.

Note that dnff first looks for paths.cfg in the directory where
the program is run (.) .  If paths.cfg is not found, dnff looks in ./CF;
failing this, the program prompts for a paths.cfg file path.
In all cases the paths in paths.cfg are relative: e.g., the data file
(which dnff prompts the user for, say dataFile.bin) is taken to be
./data/dataFile.bin; the system parameter file is taken to be
./SP/dataFile.sp; the output (for 5 channel MT) goes in
./FC/dataFile.f5.  If standard directory names and configuration
files are used, no modification of paths.cfg should be required.

--> decset.cfg  
This file (used by dnff) defines the cascade decimation scheme (number of
decimation levels, length in number of points of windows
for each level, filter coefficients for low-pass filtering before
decimation between levels, some parameters which define
maximum permissible gaps and number of FCs save.  Details and
examples are in EMTF documentation.

--> pwset.cfg
This file (used by dnff) defines the prewhitening options (length of AR filter
for each channel, decimation level).  See EMTF for documentation.

--> bs?????.cfg
This file is used by both of the processing programs (tranmt and
multmtrn) to define the frequency bands used for estimation.  The
number of frequency bands are given, together with information
to identify which Fourier coefficients are to be used for each
band--namely the decimation level, and the range of Fourier coefficient
numbers (so 3 integers for each band, one per line).
FC number i for decimation level j corresponds to frequency (in hz)
i/T(j) where T(j) is the length (in seconds) of the windows
for decimation level j (e.g., for 1 hz data at
decimation level 1 with 128 point sets (this is 
set in decset.cfg) T(1) = 128 s; if level 2 is obtained by
decimating by a factor of 4 (again, this is set in decset.cfg)
then T(2) = 512s, etc.

--> options_SS.cfg, options_RR.cfg
The options file is read by the single site and remote reference
processing program, tranmt.  The file sets various options, including
whether processing is remote reference, coherence sorting options
(not sure these all work!)  and the name of the band set up (bs????.cfg)
file to use.  Normally I keep an options_SS.cfg file for single site,
and an options_RR.cfg for remote reference.  The band setup file
name is modified most often, depending on sampling rates.  (E.g.,
very different bs files are needed for 8hz and 1 hz NIMS, to get
estimates at similar frequencies.) 

Note that there is no options file read by multmtrn (the multiple
station code).  The name of the bs file is instead passed to
multmtrn through the array.cfg file, which has names of all input
data files.

Note also that any names for the files can be used, except for paths.cfg.
Any decset and pwset file names can be set in paths.cfg; similarly
any bs file name can be set in the options.cfg files (and in array.cfg
file for multmtrn), and any name for the options files can be used.
Names of options files are passed to tranmt through the tranmt.cfg
file.  When run through the matlab interfaces, all of these input
configuration files are created "on the fly" by the interface (using
information in the paths.cfg file, plus information obtained through
the user interfaces.)
